summary_input = """Over the weekend, I spent some time visiting a local farmers’ market. The variety of fresh produce was incredible, and I ended up buying more than I planned—everything from vibrant tomatoes to fragrant herbs. It was nice to chat with the farmers and learn about where the food comes from. I even found a small bakery stand that had the most delicious bread. There's something special about supporting local businesses and enjoying seasonal foods. Later, I used some of the ingredients to make a simple salad, and the flavors were amazing. I’m thinking of making this a weekly tradition. Have you ever explored a farmers' market in your area? """
